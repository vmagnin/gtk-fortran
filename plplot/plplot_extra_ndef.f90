  ! Plplot extras for accessing the pl_cmd routine.

  use iso_c_binding

  implicit none

  ! The operation codes for pl_cmd
  ! In plplot 5.9.11 (and later?) these definitions are in the F95 binding

  ! Interface for the pl_cmd routine
  interface
     subroutine pl_cmd(cmd, arg) bind(c)
       use iso_c_binding, only: c_int, c_ptr
       integer(kind=c_int), value :: cmd
