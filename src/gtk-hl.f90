! High Level GTK Fortran interfaces
module gtk_hl
  !
  ! A collection of procedures to implement higher level creators for
  ! the gtk-fortran widgets. Some settings and operations are also
  ! provided for the more intricate widgets.
  !
  ! Many ideas in this module were taken from the pilib gtk<->fortran
  ! interface.
  !
  ! This module includes all the high-level modules apart from the
  ! drawing modules.
